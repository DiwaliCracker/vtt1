00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:02,526
No. No,
of course not.

185
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:05,462
No, I could never
blame you.

186
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:07,664
[sniffles]

187
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,368
I know how much having
a baby means to you.

188
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:16,007
But it's like
the doctor said,
miscarriages happen.

189
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,308
Especially the
first time around.

190
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:22,346
Doesn't mean
we have to give up,
does it?

191
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,118
What if
it happens again?

192
00:14:32,222 --> 00:14:34,191
I know
you're scared.

193
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:38,395
I'm scared too.

194
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,564
In the last...
[chuckles]

195
00:14:40,697 --> 00:14:45,268
...year,
I've lost our baby...

196
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,906
now my dad.

197
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:56,246
I don't know
if I can handle
another loss.

198
00:14:56,881 --> 00:14:58,382
[sniffles]

199
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,887
But I believe
in us.

200
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:09,326
Don't you?

201
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:12,329
[chuckles]
Yes.

202
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:14,464
Yes,
of course I do.

203
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:17,601
I believe in us
more than fucking anything.

204
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:19,804
I love you.

205
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:21,271
I love you.

206
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,700
[birds chirping]

207
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:51,869
[water running]

208
00:15:54,105 --> 00:15:56,473
[dishes clanking]

209
00:16:16,094 --> 00:16:17,461
[door closes]

210
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:26,204
[clock ticking]

211
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:28,572
[door creaking]

212
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:01,404
[doors creaking]

213
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:56,761
What?

214
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:08,005
[Maia] Hmm.

215
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:11,042
Yeah, I guess
I can see a resemblance.

216
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,777
A resemblance?
Yeah.

217
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,847
Maia, it looks
exactly like me.

218
00:18:18,548 --> 00:18:21,986
Yeah, well, maybe if you,
uh, wore those contacts
I bought you.

219
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,453
Oh, God.

220
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:25,488
See?

221
00:18:25,622 --> 00:18:27,724
Hmm. Yeah,
not sold.

222
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:30,928
I'm gonna need, like,
to see a scowl.

223
00:18:31,796 --> 00:18:32,997
[laughs]
There you go.

224
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,565
I'm glad
you find it funny.
[laughing]

225
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,804
All right, fine, yeah.
It does look... [stammers]

226
00:18:39,937 --> 00:18:42,206
It sort of looks like you,
yeah.

227
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,075
Thank you.
Hmm.

228
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,675
What do you
think it means?

229
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,079
I don't think
it means anything.

230
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:49,914
Mmm.
People go to museums

231
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:52,749
and see themselves
in paintings all the time.

232
00:18:53,317 --> 00:18:54,986
This wasn't in a museum.

233
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,955
It was in your attic.
Mmm.

234
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:02,126
Yeah, well, my dad
traveled a lot
for work.

235
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:04,494
He collected art.

236
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:06,097
It was one
of his passions,

237
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,833
so I guess
this could've come
from anywhere really.

238
00:19:09,532 --> 00:19:10,968
What does it say?

239
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:14,272
[Robert]
Says, <i>"The Visitor Accepts."</i>

240
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,007
Well, what exactly
is he accepting?

241
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,608
[chuckles]
I don't know.
His drink?

242
00:19:21,478 --> 00:19:23,680
Well, he's a visitor,
so maybe, uh,

243
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:27,118
he's accepting an invitation
to visit.

244
00:19:37,228 --> 00:19:40,530
You're not still taking
that medication, are you?

245
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:42,599
For your anxiety?

246
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:44,368
No.
You sure?

247
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:45,735
Yeah.

248
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:49,706
No, I-I threw that
down the toilet
months ago.

249
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,474
The doctor said
it's only for emergencies--

250
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,643
Please, Maia, come on.
Not again.

251
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:55,179
I'm off it.
I'm done.

252
00:19:55,313 --> 00:19:56,579
Okay.

253
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:15,498
[breathes deeply]

254
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:27,378
Well, here's
your receipt.

255
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,980
All right.
Okay.

256
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:32,316
It looks great.
Thank you.

257
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,550
Here you go.

258
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:35,152
You have a blessed day,
you hear?

259
00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:36,519
Thank you, Kathy.

260
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:38,923
Hi.

261
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:42,860
You're--

262
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:44,362
Robert Burrows.

263
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:47,164
Uh,
Maia Eden's husband.

264
00:20:51,936 --> 00:20:54,238
We should talk,
Robert.

265
00:20:55,106 --> 00:20:57,308
[door opens]
[entry bell jingles]

266
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:58,675
[door closes]

267
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:04,949
Will that be all?

268
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,323
Um,
just today's paper,

269
00:21:12,456 --> 00:21:13,457
if you have it.
Sure.

270
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,592
Let me grab one
for you.

271
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,937
[breathing heavily]

272
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,243
[breathing heavily
continues]

273
00:21:39,517 --> 00:21:40,583
All righty, then.

274
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,319
Here you go.
Great. Thank you.

275
00:21:42,453 --> 00:21:43,586
That's awesome.

276
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,555
Um, how much
do I owe you?

277
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:48,325
Oh, please.
Your money's no good here.

278
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:49,692
[chuckles]

279
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:59,303
Art is a lie
that makes us
realize the truth.

280
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:09,013
You have a blessed day,
now.

281
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:14,819
Okay. [smacks lips]

282
00:22:27,664 --> 00:22:30,667
[Robert] <i>Yeah, so it's two boxes</i>
<i>that haven't been delivered.</i>

283
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:32,236
[agent]
<i>Two boxes from London?</i>
Yeah. Yeah.

284
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:36,673
One of them is a, uh...
just a bunch
of personal items,

285
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:38,943
and then
in the other one,
there's a suit.

286
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:40,811
<i>And you still</i>
<i>have not received them?</i>

287
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:42,780
Right.
<i>What's</i>
<i>the tracking number?</i>

288
00:22:42,913 --> 00:22:44,148
Yeah, no. No, no, no.

289
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:46,450
We-we, uh, we never received
a tracking number.

290
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:48,685
<i>Can I transfer you</i>
<i>to our shipping department?</i>

291
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:50,788
Okay.
Yeah, sure, I can wait.

292
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,224
[line beeping]

293
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:56,659
[agent 2] <i>This is Mike</i>
<i>from shipping.</i>

294
00:22:56,794 --> 00:22:57,928
Hello.
<i>Hello.</i>

295
00:22:58,062 --> 00:23:00,030
Hi. Yes. Yeah.
So this is--

296
00:23:00,164 --> 00:23:02,066
<i>Two boxes missing?</i>
Yeah. Yeah.

297
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:04,401
This is probably
the fourth person

298
00:23:04,535 --> 00:23:05,870
I've spoken to
about this.

299
00:23:06,003 --> 00:23:07,204
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

300
00:23:07,338 --> 00:23:09,907
Yeah, we haven't
received two boxes.

301
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,409
<i>Okay.</i>
We never got
a tracking number either.

302
00:23:12,543 --> 00:23:14,011
A couple of people
have said that,

303
00:23:14,145 --> 00:23:16,514
on your end, it says
it's been delivered.

304
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:17,882
[Maia]
<i>Here.</i>

305
00:23:22,553 --> 00:23:24,388
I don't know.

306
00:23:24,522 --> 00:23:25,623
Your dad's suit?

307
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:27,391
Well, you already stole
his overalls.

308
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:30,861
Yeah,
but to his memorial?

309
00:23:30,995 --> 00:23:33,230
Well,
he wasn't wearing it
when he died.

310
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:35,199
Go on.

311
00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:38,269
[Joseph]
<i>We are here today</i>

312
00:23:38,402 --> 00:23:41,172
<i>to remember</i>
<i>the fortuitous life</i>

313
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:44,441
of Edgar Cartwell Eden.

314
00:23:45,643 --> 00:23:47,244
Like most of us,

315
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:50,915
Edgar's roots
in this town go...

316
00:23:51,048 --> 00:23:53,184
go back generations.

317
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,252
All the way back
to the early days
when this was

318
00:23:55,386 --> 00:23:58,088
just a patch of dirt
on a road
to someplace else.

319
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:00,391
With Edgar's help

320
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:05,362
and the help
of generations of Edens
that came before him,

321
00:24:05,496 --> 00:24:10,134
Briar Glen was allowed
to-to become the safe haven

322
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:13,103
for our community
that it is today.

323
00:24:15,406 --> 00:24:17,641
Y'all know how much

324
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:20,411
Edgar loved this town
with all of his heart.

325
00:24:21,445 --> 00:24:26,383
He gave as much of himself
as he could possibly afford.

326
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:32,356
He carried the weight
of his family's legacy
with honor and dignity.

327
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:35,025
And make no mistake,

328
00:24:36,193 --> 00:24:40,264
we are less because of
his devastating absence.

329
00:24:44,068 --> 00:24:45,735
But there is hope.

330
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:50,174
And that has come
to us in the form
of Edgar's daughter Maia

331
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:54,211
and her new husband,
Robert Burrows.

332
00:24:54,345 --> 00:24:56,746
Robert, why don't you
stand up, let everybody
get a look at you?

333
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,582
Everybody, give him
some encouragement.

334
00:24:58,716 --> 00:25:00,484
Robert!
Come on, Robert!

335
00:25:08,392 --> 00:25:10,661
Robert, I know
you're new to these parts,

336
00:25:10,794 --> 00:25:12,529
but I speak for everyone
when I say

337
00:25:12,663 --> 00:25:14,898
you already feel
like one of us.

338
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:19,103
[chuckles]

339
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:22,039
Thank you.

340
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:23,907
[Maia
clears throat]

341
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:26,043
[clears throat]

342
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:28,812
[Joseph]
All right.

343
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:32,683
Nobody minds,
I think I'll read
from the big book again.

344
00:25:32,816 --> 00:25:35,486
I like the words.
[scattered chuckles]

345
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:38,956
And I'll keep it short.
It's getting a mite warm
in here, I know.

346
00:25:45,764 --> 00:25:47,064
[Robert]
Hey.

347
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:51,735
Gonna head out
to the shops.
You want anything?

348
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:54,204
Um, no,
not that I can think of.

349
00:25:54,338 --> 00:25:56,106
I'll call you
if I do.

350
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,142
Okay.

351
00:26:00,844 --> 00:26:02,946
[door opens]
[entry bell jingles]

352
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,315
[door closes]

353
00:26:25,135 --> 00:26:26,437
Can I help you?

354
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:28,773
Oh. Hi.

355
00:26:28,906 --> 00:26:32,042
I'm actually looking
for the other lady
that works here.

356
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:36,947
I'm sorry.
Kathy's not here
right now.

357
00:26:37,915 --> 00:26:41,118
Do you know
when she'll be back?

358
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:43,220
[chuckles]

359
00:26:43,354 --> 00:26:46,056
Can I just say,
on a personal note,

360
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,692
how lovely it is
to have you here
in Briar Glen?

361
00:26:48,827 --> 00:26:53,297
The town has been
infinitely brighter
since you arrived.

362
00:26:54,598 --> 00:26:57,968
I'd be happy
to help you find anything
you might need.

363
00:27:00,772 --> 00:27:02,239
Uh... [chuckles]

364
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:08,178
[sighs]

365
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:05,169
[entry bell jingles]

366
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,072
Hello?

367
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:17,347
Hello?

368
00:30:06,523 --> 00:30:08,659
<i>"The Visitor</i>
<i>Watches It Burn."</i>

369
00:30:11,428 --> 00:30:12,964
[owner]
That's not for sale.

370
00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:14,966
[Robert]
Oh, um...

371
00:30:15,098 --> 00:30:16,567
I'm sorry.
I, uh...

372
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:20,304
I was just hoping
you might be able to

373
00:30:20,437 --> 00:30:22,606
give me some more
information about it.

374
00:30:23,307 --> 00:30:25,309
Anything would be
really helpful.

375
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:28,312
It was here
when I bought the store.

376
00:30:30,314 --> 00:30:32,549
And judging
by your accent,

377
00:30:32,683 --> 00:30:38,255
I bet your schools
didn't teach you
the history of this place.

378
00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:40,858
So I'll give you
the short version.

379
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,330
There was a whole lot
of bad going on
back then.

380
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:52,402
And I'm not
the kind of person
who hides from evil.

381
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,137
No, sir, I--

382
00:30:57,942 --> 00:30:59,610
No.

383
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:02,746
It can't be.

384
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:08,552
[chuckles] I know.

385
00:31:09,686 --> 00:31:11,688
Believe me,
I was shocked, too,
when I found it.

386
00:31:11,823 --> 00:31:15,392
I found another one
just like it
in my wife's family's house.

387
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:18,662
Look,
I took a picture.

388
00:31:18,796 --> 00:31:20,098
How did you find me?

389
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,365
It was a woman
named Kathy.

390
00:31:21,498 --> 00:31:25,268
She works in a store
in, uh, Briar Glen.

391
00:31:25,402 --> 00:31:27,671
She gave me this note
with your address on it.

392
00:31:27,805 --> 00:31:32,476
You listen to me,
and you listen good.

393
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:35,113
You think
you want answers.

394
00:31:35,245 --> 00:31:36,881
You're wrong.

395
00:31:37,015 --> 00:31:40,550
The truth is
your worst enemy.

396
00:31:40,684 --> 00:31:44,187
What you need
is to run back
to London

397
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:46,256
as fast as your legs
can carry you.

398
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,658
Do you understand me?
Yeah.

399
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:49,259
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have
come here.

400
00:31:49,393 --> 00:31:50,727
Now go
and don't come back.
I'm sorry.

401
00:31:50,862 --> 00:31:52,362
I wanted to check--
Don't you ever
come back!

402
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:54,398
I'm leaving,
I'm leaving.
Sorry.

403
00:31:54,531 --> 00:31:55,632
Go!

404
00:31:58,168 --> 00:31:59,403

00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,335
[Maia]
Hey. Where were you?

409
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:35,773
I was worried.

410
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:41,745
What's that
doing up there?

411
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:43,346
What,
we can't laugh
about this yet?

412
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,949
Come on.
[chuckles]

413
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,520
You know,
I just found
another one.

414
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,092
What?
Another painting.

415
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:55,760
Of him.

416
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:59,563
This time, he was, um...
he was, like,
a Confederate soldier.

417
00:32:59,696 --> 00:33:03,000
There was this crazy
old lady there,
and she was, like...

418
00:33:03,134 --> 00:33:04,735
she was, like,
clawing at me.

419
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:06,336
She said
I had to move back
to London.

420
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,172
What--
How did she know
I was from London?

421
00:33:08,338 --> 00:33:10,540
Your accent?
No. No, no, no,
no, no.

422
00:33:10,674 --> 00:33:12,442
It was--
it was definitely
more than that.

423
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:13,811
It felt like she...

424
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:17,215
I felt like
she-she knew me.

425
00:33:17,347 --> 00:33:18,615
The way
she was looking
at me.

426
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:20,283
I feel like
everyone knows me.

427
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:21,819
Robert,
okay, listen.

428
00:33:21,953 --> 00:33:23,653
I put this painting up
because I thought
it would be

429
00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:27,390
a funny, you know,
inside joke
between the two of us.

430
00:33:30,061 --> 00:33:34,631
I mean, you don't actually
think that's you
in the paintings? [chuckles]

431
00:33:42,706 --> 00:33:43,740
Robert.

432
00:33:46,077 --> 00:33:47,410
I-I don't know.
It--

433
00:33:47,544 --> 00:33:49,613
Oh, my God.
It looks like me.

434
00:33:49,746 --> 00:33:52,449
This has got
to stop, Robert.

435
00:33:55,652 --> 00:33:58,022
We're gonna make
this place our home.

436
00:33:58,823 --> 00:34:00,323
Do you even
want to be here?

437
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:01,558
Yes. Yes, I do.

438
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:03,261
Are you sure?
Yes, of course.

439
00:34:03,393 --> 00:34:04,796
Of course. Yes.

440
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:06,396

[sighs]

442
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:11,701
Just think the stress
is getting to me.

443
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:17,307
The bad dreams,
the move.

444
00:34:19,743 --> 00:34:20,477
[sighs]

445
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,780
You're right.

446
00:34:22,914 --> 00:34:27,384
I just need to, like,
focus on you.

447
00:34:27,517 --> 00:34:30,320
And us and this house
we're in.

449
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:39,997
Know what?

450
00:34:40,898 --> 00:34:42,732
I'm gonna go
finish up in here.

and with him the prophet

Now, our Maia,

500
00:42:05,643 --> 00:42:08,312
she was always first
through the door
at Sunday school

501
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:10,014
and last to leave.

502
00:42:10,147 --> 00:42:12,182
I had to kick her out
on, well...

503
00:42:12,316 --> 00:42:14,084
Oh.
...more than
one occasion.

504
00:42:14,218 --> 00:42:15,386
Don't give me
that face.

505
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:17,354
You know it's true,
you little rascal.

506
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:20,824
Ah, watch it. It's hot.

507
00:42:22,493 --> 00:42:23,794
[Maia]
Thank you.

508
00:42:25,296 --> 00:42:26,363
[sighs]

509
00:42:27,331 --> 00:42:32,803
To your strong, healthy,
miracle baby boy.

510
00:42:34,171 --> 00:42:36,173
Cheers.
Cheers.

511
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:41,011
Well, that's not
gonna do.
Drink up.

512

[chuckles]

513
00:42:48,352 --> 00:42:51,422
You know, Robert,
I've been meaning
to ask you something.

514
00:42:55,192 --> 00:42:57,127
Are you
a true believer?

515
00:43:01,932 --> 00:43:03,334
Honestly, I'm not.

516
00:43:04,935 --> 00:43:06,503
Would you give me
your hands?

517
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:09,406
[whispers]
Come on.

518
00:43:11,141 --> 00:43:12,609
Come on, now.
Give me your hands.

00:43:12,743 --> 00:43:14,311

522
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:34,365
[whispers] You will.

523
00:43:35,432 --> 00:43:36,633
You will be.

524
00:43:36,768 --> 00:43:40,971
When you see for yourself,
you won't be able to deny.

525
00:43:45,142 --> 00:43:48,178
The, um...
the christening's
important to Maia.

526
00:43:48,312 --> 00:43:49,814
So it's important
to me too.

527
00:43:49,947 --> 00:43:51,415
Thank you.

528
00:43:56,019 --> 00:43:58,222
Well, of course.

529
00:43:58,355 --> 00:43:59,523
Of course.

530
00:43:59,656 --> 00:44:02,192
And I don't want you
to have any fears about that.

531
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:05,162
We do
a simple ceremony.

532
00:44:07,664 --> 00:44:10,701

drowning the newborn
around here.

That's a relief.

534
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:15,606
Listen,
I'm just gonna go
and use the loo.

535
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:17,341
Okay. Bye.

536
00:44:18,777 --> 00:44:19,778
Oh, he means
the bathroom.

537
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:22,146
Oh. Down the hall
to the right.

538
00:44:28,652 --> 00:44:30,354
[sighs]

539
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:36,026
[exhales]

540
00:45:08,927 --> 00:45:11,328
[floorboards creaking]

541
00:46:10,087 --> 00:46:11,856
[floorboard creaks]

542
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:14,558
Thought I was gonna
have to send out
a search party for you.

543
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:18,863
Sorry.
I-I took a wrong turn,
and I-I saw this painting.

544
00:46:18,997 --> 00:46:20,364
It's...

545
00:46:22,165 --> 00:46:23,868
Do you think it...

546
00:46:24,002 --> 00:46:24,969
It's you.

547
00:46:25,102 --> 00:46:26,670
Yeah.

548
00:46:29,273 --> 00:46:31,208
[laughs] You should see
the look on your face.

549
00:46:31,341 --> 00:46:34,444
I had you there
for a minute,
didn't I? [laughs]

550
00:46:36,146 --> 00:46:37,581
No, no.

551
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:42,185
This here is none other
than the great
Alistair Edgar.

552
00:46:43,253 --> 00:46:45,455
Man that saved
this town.

553
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:50,527
See, when our ancestors
first settled this place,
it was...

554
00:46:51,261 --> 00:46:53,463
it was dire.

555
00:46:53,597 --> 00:46:55,867
Famine, disease.

556
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,735
The loss
of human life,
it was...

557
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:00,404
it was unthinkable.

558
00:47:00,537 --> 00:47:05,742
To say it plainly,
this place was going
to hell in a handbag.

559
00:47:05,877 --> 00:47:07,311
That is, until

560
00:47:08,445 --> 00:47:12,182
Alistair found a way
to pull it up
out of the mud

561
00:47:12,316 --> 00:47:14,384
with his own
fair hands.

562
00:47:14,518 --> 00:47:17,521
Now, this portrait
was a gift from Alistair
to the town.

563
00:47:17,654 --> 00:47:21,692
But if you ask me,
real gift was
Alistair himself.

564
00:47:21,826 --> 00:47:24,127
You can't imagine
how inspiring it is
for me

565
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:26,064
to wake up
every morning,

566
00:47:26,196 --> 00:47:28,298
first thing I see
is that man's face.

567
00:47:30,467 --> 00:47:32,502
It's the gift
that keeps on giving.

568
00:47:35,773 --> 00:47:38,342
I've seen other paintings
just like this.

569
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,080
I swear it's the same guy
in every single one.

570
00:47:42,212 --> 00:47:46,751
He's...
He's always referred to
as "The Visitor."

571
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:51,455
I mean, could it be
that it's Alistair
in every one?

572
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:54,391
[sucks teeth]

573
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,295
Genesis 1:27.

574
00:47:59,262 --> 00:48:01,866
"God created man
in his own image,

575
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:04,869
in the image of God

576
00:48:05,402 --> 00:48:07,337
he created him."

577
00:48:08,773 --> 00:48:09,740
What does that mean?

578
00:48:09,874 --> 00:48:11,508
Right.

579
00:48:11,642 --> 00:48:14,112
Bible verses
aren't your thing.

580
00:48:14,244 --> 00:48:16,446
[chuckles]
How about this?

581
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,216
There can never
be too much
of a good thing.

582
00:48:21,385 --> 00:48:23,620
I would just take it
as a sign.

583
00:48:23,755 --> 00:48:27,125
You are where
you are meant to be.

584
00:48:27,257 --> 00:48:28,860
And you know what?

585
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:31,228
I think maybe it's time
for you to get
that young Maia home.

586
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:32,930
She needs her rest.

587
00:48:33,064 --> 00:48:34,164
Sure.
Yeah, you're right.

588
00:48:34,297 --> 00:48:36,166
Um, look,
I'm sorry.

589
00:48:36,299 --> 00:48:37,769
I didn't mean
to come into your--

590
00:48:37,902 --> 00:48:39,569
Stop right there.

591
00:48:39,703 --> 00:48:43,041
You are welcome to go
anywhere you want to,
Robert.

592
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:46,710
We're just so glad
that you are back.

593
00:48:50,882 --> 00:48:52,884
[Maia] <i>I still cannot believe</i>
<i>you went in his bedroom.</i>

594
00:48:53,017 --> 00:48:54,584
He had one
of those paintings.

595
00:48:54,718 --> 00:48:56,453
Again with the paintings.
He said his name
was Alistair Edgar.

596
00:48:56,586 --> 00:48:57,721
Robert, please,
you promised--

597
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,957
He said he was
the founder of your town.

598
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:02,994
Alistair Edgar?

599
00:49:03,127 --> 00:49:06,563
Alistair Edgar
was born in the 1700s.

600
00:49:06,697 --> 00:49:09,266
So unless you have
a time machine
that I'm not aware of,

601
00:49:09,399 --> 00:49:10,701
I don't know
what to tell you,
Robert.

602
00:49:10,835 --> 00:49:12,369
I know I'm starting
to sound crazy,

603
00:49:12,502 --> 00:49:14,438
but this is really,
really beginning to--

604
00:49:14,571 --> 00:49:16,808
Oh, God.
[toads croaking]

605
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,594
Hey.

606
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:13,296
Oh. Hey.

607
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:14,766
Where you going?

608
00:50:14,899 --> 00:50:17,501
I'm just off to, uh,
a doctor's appointment.

609
00:50:17,634 --> 00:50:19,904
Oh. Oh,
I didn't-didn't realize.

610
00:50:20,037 --> 00:50:22,039
No, it's not, uh,
anything important.

611
00:50:22,173 --> 00:50:23,241
It's just
a quick checkup.

612
00:50:23,406 --> 00:50:24,708
So I'm fine.
Oh. You sure?

613
00:50:24,842 --> 00:50:26,944
Yeah. Just wanted
to do this alone,

614
00:50:27,078 --> 00:50:29,247
if that's okay.
Okay.

615
00:50:29,379 --> 00:50:30,614
Bye.

616
00:50:32,216 --> 00:50:33,951
[door opens]

617
00:50:37,554 --> 00:50:39,523
[door closes]

618
00:50:57,374 --> 00:50:59,676
[vibrating]

619
00:51:04,048 --> 00:51:05,515
Hello.

620
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:07,852
[person]
<i>Mr. Burrows,</i>
<i>I presume?</i>

621
00:51:09,887 --> 00:51:11,388
Yeah, speaking.

622
00:51:11,521 --> 00:51:13,090
<i>You're alone,</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

623
00:51:14,591 --> 00:51:15,927
Yeah, I'm alone.

624
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,161
Who is this?

625
00:51:17,295 --> 00:51:18,796
<i>Let that be</i>
<i>your first lesson.</i>

626
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:22,033
<i>In the town of Briar Glen,</i>
<i>you, sir, are never alone.</i>

627
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:25,169
Okay,
thanks for that.
I'm gonna hang up.

628
00:51:25,303 --> 00:51:26,703
<i>No. Wait.</i>

629
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:29,774
What is it?

630
00:51:30,975 --> 00:51:32,576
<i>I want you to come</i>
<i>to the window</i>

631
00:51:32,709 --> 00:51:34,846
<i>on the far east side</i>
<i>of your house.</i>

632
00:51:34,979 --> 00:51:36,247
<i>Look outside.</i>

633
00:51:36,379 --> 00:51:37,547
I'm really not
in the mood, okay?

634
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:39,683
<i>I assure you</i>
<i>I am deadly serious.</i>

635
00:51:39,817 --> 00:51:42,419
<i>Just ask</i>
<i>our mutual acquaintance,</i>

636
00:51:42,552 --> 00:51:44,354
<i>The Visitor.</i>

637
00:52:03,908 --> 00:52:06,110
[engine idling]

638
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:14,318
[chuckles]

639
00:52:14,451 --> 00:52:16,720
My, my.

640
00:52:16,854 --> 00:52:18,421
Will you look
at that?

641
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:20,892
It really is uncanny,
isn't it?

642
00:52:23,895 --> 00:52:24,862
Maxwell Braun.

643
00:52:24,996 --> 00:52:27,198
Purveyor of fine arts
and antiquities.

644
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:30,368
Please get in
before anyone sees us.

645
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,105
Yeah, I... I don't think
I'm gonna do that. Thanks.

646
00:52:35,273 --> 00:52:36,807
You want answers,
don't you?

647
00:52:38,475 --> 00:52:39,409
[sighs]

648
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:41,511
It's now or never.

649
00:52:44,181 --> 00:52:46,083
[birds chirping]

650
00:52:47,051 --> 00:52:49,619
[Braun] I call this
"The Visitor series."

651
00:52:51,789 --> 00:52:54,292
This is the first one
that caught my eye.

652
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:55,893
I was shopping
a collection in Germany,

653
00:52:56,027 --> 00:52:58,695
mostly pieces
from the '30s and '40s,

654
00:52:58,829 --> 00:53:01,698
around the time
of the Second World War.

655
00:53:01,832 --> 00:53:04,701
It was completely buried
amongst the morass.

656
00:53:04,835 --> 00:53:06,871
But something about it
called to me.

657
00:53:07,004 --> 00:53:09,340
If I'm honest,
I think it was
'cause I thought

658
00:53:09,472 --> 00:53:10,875
you were easy
on the eyes.

659
00:53:11,008 --> 00:53:12,176
[chuckles]

660
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:13,411
Or he was.

661
00:53:13,543 --> 00:53:15,346
Whatever.
You get my point.

662
00:53:15,478 --> 00:53:16,881
Anyway...
[clears throat]

663
00:53:17,014 --> 00:53:19,150
...I purchased it
to add to my collection,

664
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:21,718
then after some time,
it faded from memory.

665
00:53:21,852 --> 00:53:24,121
That is,
until a few years later

666
00:53:25,156 --> 00:53:26,723
when I came across this.

667
00:53:36,267 --> 00:53:37,902
All right, this is...

668
00:53:38,035 --> 00:53:39,736
this is really starting
to creep me out now.

669
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:43,707
These are just
the tip of the iceberg.

670
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:47,477
Congo during
Leopold's brutal reign.

671
00:53:48,511 --> 00:53:49,679
Cambodian genocide

672
00:53:49,814 --> 00:53:51,849
during the 1970s.

673
00:53:52,682 --> 00:53:54,118
It became an obsession.

674
00:53:54,251 --> 00:53:58,756
Mining collections,
libraries, museums,
estate sales.

675
00:53:58,889 --> 00:54:02,927
Uncovering hundreds of photos,
all of them featuring

676
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,328
this same man.

677
00:54:04,462 --> 00:54:07,164
And each of them
corresponding to moments
in human history

678
00:54:07,298 --> 00:54:09,699
we wish
we could forget.

679
00:54:12,903 --> 00:54:14,238
Is his name Alistair?

680
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:18,275
I spent years trying
to ascertain his identity.

681
00:54:18,409 --> 00:54:19,642
To no avail.

682
00:54:20,311 --> 00:54:21,611
Nearly drove me mad.

683
00:54:21,745 --> 00:54:24,415
Then one frustrating
drunken night,

684
00:54:24,547 --> 00:54:26,683
I stumbled across
an online forum

685
00:54:26,817 --> 00:54:31,022
dedicated to rare
and forgotten
contemporary art.

686
00:54:31,155 --> 00:54:32,156
[sighs]

687
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:34,691
That's where I met
Margaret Delacroix.

688
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:39,830
From the antique store.
Yeah.

689
00:54:39,964 --> 00:54:41,999
She tumbled down
this rabbit hole
years before me.

690
00:54:42,133 --> 00:54:44,268
Along with a group
of like-minded
individuals,

691
00:54:44,402 --> 00:54:47,772
she made
significant strides
towards discovering

692
00:54:47,905 --> 00:54:51,208
the insidious truth
behind this man's
identity.

693
00:54:52,076 --> 00:54:56,047
And for that,
she paid the ultimate price.

694
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,686
She died?

695
00:55:10,428 --> 00:55:11,829
So who is he?

696
00:55:13,197 --> 00:55:16,599
He is both you
and not you, Robert.

697
00:55:20,737 --> 00:55:22,206
What does that
even mean?

698
00:55:22,339 --> 00:55:25,409
It means you're still
in control
of your own destiny.

699
00:55:25,543 --> 00:55:27,411
You can decide.

700
00:55:27,545 --> 00:55:30,481
But just know
that decision will have
graver repercussions

701
00:55:30,613 --> 00:55:32,083
than you could ever
possibly fathom.

702
00:55:32,216 --> 00:55:35,553
Can you just please
just stop talking to me
in riddles?

703
00:55:35,685 --> 00:55:36,754
What decision?

704
00:55:36,887 --> 00:55:40,458
Just tell me,
honestly and clearly,

705
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,093
what the fuck
is going on?

706
00:55:42,226 --> 00:55:43,861
[sighs]

707
00:55:46,696 --> 00:55:48,731
This is not
your home, Robert.

708
00:55:48,866 --> 00:55:50,334
These people
are not your friends.

709
00:55:50,468 --> 00:55:52,803
And if you're being
honest with yourself,

710
00:55:52,937 --> 00:55:55,506
I think you know
that already.

711
00:55:55,638 --> 00:55:58,042
Their gain is not only
your loss,

712
00:55:58,175 --> 00:56:00,411
but the rest
of the world's loss
as well.

713
00:56:00,544 --> 00:56:02,913
But you can
still leave.

714
00:56:03,047 --> 00:56:04,681
Go back to London,
or better yet,

715
00:56:04,815 --> 00:56:06,749
find somewhere
even more remote

716
00:56:06,884 --> 00:56:09,086
where nobody can
possibly find you.

717
00:56:10,421 --> 00:56:11,856
By all means,
be happy.

718
00:56:11,989 --> 00:56:14,758
Use this money
to create and live
a comfortable life.

719
00:56:14,892 --> 00:56:17,128
Just live it
anonymously.

720
00:56:19,363 --> 00:56:20,998
What about my wife?

721
00:56:21,132 --> 00:56:22,967
We're expecting a son.
I can't just leave.

722
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,168
[sighs]

723
00:56:24,301 --> 00:56:25,735
A boy.

724
00:56:26,837 --> 00:56:28,572
This is even more urgent
than I thought.

725
00:56:28,705 --> 00:56:30,808
What has my son
got to do with this?

726
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:33,676
You, your son
and every male heir
in your bloodline

727
00:56:33,811 --> 00:56:36,713
from here until eternity
will be affected

728
00:56:36,847 --> 00:56:38,648
by the choice
you make, Robert.

729
00:56:38,782 --> 00:56:41,919
Go, and be the good man
you were raised to be.

730
00:56:42,052 --> 00:56:44,922
Or stay and end up
in one of these photos.

731
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:49,260
Stay and become
The Visitor.

732

[pounds table]
Robert!

738
00:58:14,812 --> 00:58:16,547
Been thinking
a lot recently.

739
00:58:18,015 --> 00:58:21,452
What with the baby coming,
everything that's going on
with these paintings--

740
00:58:21,585 --> 00:58:22,786
Again with
the paintings.

741
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,089
I think we should move
back to London.

742
00:58:27,858 --> 00:58:28,993
Excuse me?

743
00:58:29,126 --> 00:58:32,596
Something is off
about this place, Maia.

744
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:36,066
Maybe you don't see it
because you grew up here.

745
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,102
Maybe you blocked it out.

746
00:58:38,736 --> 00:58:40,704
But I don't feel safe.

747
00:58:40,838 --> 00:58:44,441
Why? Because you bear
a passing resemblance
to a man in a painting?

748
00:58:44,575 --> 00:58:46,477
Yes. Actually, that.

749
00:58:47,578 --> 00:58:50,881
Since we got here,
there have been
real consequences.

750
00:58:51,015 --> 00:58:52,216
People have died.

751
00:58:52,349 --> 00:58:53,417
Who?

752
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:55,686
Margaret Delacroix,
the lady from the art shop.

753
00:58:55,819 --> 00:58:58,656
And what about Kathy?
One minute, she's here,
the next minute, she's gone.

754
00:58:58,789 --> 00:58:59,758
I'm sure Kathy is fine.
Poof.

755
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:02,393
And no one
seems to care!

756
00:59:03,661 --> 00:59:05,729
What if we're next?

757
00:59:05,863 --> 00:59:07,698
Do you know how crazy
this sounds, Robert?

758
00:59:07,831 --> 00:59:10,734
Why? Because I want
to raise my child
in a place that feels safe?

759
00:59:10,868 --> 00:59:13,070
No, what's crazy
is that after we've taken
all of our stuff

760
00:59:13,203 --> 00:59:15,139
halfway across the world,
now you're pulling this shit?

761
00:59:15,272 --> 00:59:17,308
I'm not pulling
anything.

762
00:59:18,409 --> 00:59:20,377
I met a guy today,
said his name
was Maxwell Braun.

763
00:59:20,511 --> 00:59:23,414
Maxwell Braun?
That's what this is about?
He's famously insane!

764
00:59:23,547 --> 00:59:25,149
He had information.
He showed me photos.

765
00:59:25,282 --> 00:59:27,051
What about me?
[pounds table]

766
00:59:27,818 --> 00:59:28,787
What about
what I want?

767
00:59:28,919 --> 00:59:31,388
This is my home, Robert.

768
00:59:31,522 --> 00:59:36,694
And for once in my life,
it's starting to feel
like my home.

769
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:38,929
I'm not gonna give that up
over some fucking delusion.

770
00:59:39,063 --> 00:59:41,800
This is not
a fucking delusion.

771
00:59:41,932 --> 00:59:43,267
Okay?

772
00:59:58,549 --> 00:59:59,950
You can go to London.

773
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:06,190
You'll be going alone.

783
01:01:58,837 --> 01:02:00,304

I wanted to tell you
for so long.

you weren't ready.

Don't you understand?

858
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:53,557
I was sent out
into the world
as a little girl

859
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:55,526
to find you
and bring you home.

860
01:12:55,658 --> 01:12:56,827
Took me years!

so much for this family!

have been telling you

but you need to listen to me.

supposed to mean?
