1
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,312
Ryu-chan

2
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,104
I got breakfast

3
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,336
I'll enjoy having this

4
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
Hard fried egg opened and said

5
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
Overcooked mom

6
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,136
Yu-chan looks sleepy

7
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
The school is still dim

8
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936
Usseewa this earth

9
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:35,136
Go out somewhere

10
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:41,536
Where does it matter

11
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:47,936
Wait a minute, fried egg

12
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
Yesterday I got a call from her dad next week

13
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:07,136
I made a note that I'm coming back with a picture of my child

14
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:49,376
Hikikomori, you

15
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
Withdrawal in Manken's club room Eh Kaito's Manma Now

16
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:02,176
Hashiguchi is a little old

17
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
Unlike you, it's hard to go to a prep school, isn't it?

18
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
Well that's right

19
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:21,375
She needs a break, she doesn't even have her now

20
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27,775
I contacted you when I was free

21
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:34,175
I don't know what to do, she's a game

22
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,575
You now she

23
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:53,375
I used to know it when I was in high school.

24
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:59,775
Well, my parents are strict

25
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:06,175
There were various things like coming home at 7 pm, after all

26
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,575
It ’s only after she graduated, that ’s not the case.

27
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
The pride that she was the most popular in Manken of all time

28
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:25,375
Unlike you guys, she's like that and chicken

29
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:31,775
Not yet

30
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
But also for Saryusuke

31
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,575
I don't think that was the case with you

32
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,975
It was kind, she didn't speak at all, she wasn't even in the Soviet Union

33
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,375
If you force me, why

34
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:03,775
I'm scared of my eyes

35
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:10,175
All my father's fireballs are two

36
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,575
My mother's family is all alone

37
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,975
Sena is now in our class Kubogi

38
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
The child you liked seems to have got married

39
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:35,775
Well, I was on good terms with that cute girl for a while.

40
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:42,175
I always said she had Yusuke's eyes

41
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:48,575
A little scary

42
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,975
Help me a little, what's she doing?

43
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:10,847
It's all because of Abukawa

44
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:17,247
Especially she has this email

45
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,647
This scene of mine

46
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:30,047
The worst of following me

47
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:36,447
It's all because of him

48
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,647
I'm back

49
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:02,047
Grandpa is curry today

50
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:21,247
it is cold today

51
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:59,647
What happened

52
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:25,247
Why is this face

53
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:38,047
Is it wrong?

54
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:10,047
Always

55
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:16,447
I want to write a little

56
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:22,847

A little bit

60
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:01,407
Why did I give birth to such a face?

61
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,807
I'm a club activity failure

62
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007

66
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:59,263
sorry

67
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,663
Nice

68
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,271
Why did you do this?

00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:16,671
Google flowers

70
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,727
I understand

71
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,727
Be quiet

72
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,295
A little

73
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:53,695
Your fault

74
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,343

What are you doing

77
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,423
You should do this and she should be quiet

78
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,887
Cat litter

79
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:24,287
You're bad

80
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:51,839
I'm not a mother

81
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:58,239
You're bad

82
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,976
I'm sorry

83
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,648
Donna

84
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:51,456
It's your fault

85
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:58,624
why

86
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,304
Can't move

87
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,224
do not look at me

88
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:48,800
Because there is a rice cooker

89
00:33:55,456 --> 00:34:01,600
Mom

90
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:52,288
She has to go to the part

91
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:56,384
Goodbye type

92
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,864
CD does not make more sound

93
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,032
high school

94
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:52,864
That yourself

95
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,080
Hey soon

96
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064

105
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,183
I'll be back a little longer

106
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,463

Properly

138
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,303
Sleeping

You can have this

144
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:36,639
That's it

145
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,967
Oh yeah yeah

146
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,119
hello

147
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:44,287
She hasn't told her if she's going to school with Arisa

148
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:51,455
I think he will say that

149
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:57,855
This is because you don't take it as a mother and as a parent without me

150
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:00,415
excuse me

151
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:07,327
For the time being, I'll be riding the first Shinkansen the morning after tomorrow, so will I speak firmly when I return?

152
01:13:55,199 --> 01:14:01,343

153
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:07,743
I'll bring that

154
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:20,543
Because it ’s the day my dad will come back tomorrow.

155
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,687
Such a thing

156
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,735
What's wrong

157
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:33,087
How much do you shift your mother?

158
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,647
That kind of girlfriend is sick

159
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,207
If you are not a parent

160
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,767
I was able to walk a normal life

161
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:52,799
What are you hitting

162
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:57,151
I'm sorry Ryu-chan

163
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,687
I am really sorry

164
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:05,343
I'm sorry she has a bad mom

165
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:07,647
I am really sorry

166
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:14,047
But she wants a child as a mother

167
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:20,447
My dad told me not to make it

168
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:23,775
She just couldn't give up

169
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:30,175
When Ryu-chan was made

170
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:36,575
I was happy

171
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,879
Mom

172
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:47,583
Give up

173
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:53,983
I didn't let you

174
01:15:54,239 --> 01:16:00,383
I am really sorry

175
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:19,583
Someone like you

176
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:49,472
Touch

177
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,152
White teeth

178
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:59,200

180
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,304
Properly

181
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:58,528
Mom

182
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:04,416
sorry

183
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:42,304
Does not heal

184
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:58,272
Shin-chan and mom

185
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:10,304
Doing with mom

186
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:23,104
I'm sorry I thought it was a failure

187
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:48,704
sorry

188
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,408
Just in a house like this

189
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:32,736
University is not free

190
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:37,088
Almost always you

191
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:41,184
Isn't it bad because you're not disciplined?

192
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:45,792
I'm leaving the house to you

193
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:48,352
But I'm in trouble without her

194
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:51,424
I work outside

195
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:55,264
I'm paying for my living expenses

196
01:55:55,776 --> 01:56:01,664
Mom not bad

197
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:10,880
Any attitude

198
