2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,460
Lena

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,680
what?

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,700
Tomorrow's work

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,450
Lena, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,260
Because I'm not making much money

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,380
I made the leader do too much.

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:32,850
Are you okay

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,250
Because we're a married couple

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,370
We have to help each other.

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,070
And

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,630
Because it's fun and easy

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,490
That's good then

14
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,550
It's been three years since we got married.

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,350
The two of them are living a happy married life.

16
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,180
But I was hiding something from my husband.

17
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,470
Wow, that's amazing! You're number one again!

18
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:08,970
thank you

19
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,050
I've been a nanpawan since I joined the store.

20
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,850
It's already a milestone in the history of our store.

21
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,450
Is that so? I'm happy.

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,220
Keep it up, I hope you'll continue supporting me this month.

23
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,550
I bought a house last year

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,460
At that timing

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,020
My husband passed and was mentioned.

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,320
I have a lot of money to pay for my house.

27
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,120
Good income

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,180
I decided to work at Soplan.

29
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:52,870
To my husband

30
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,430
He lies about it being a sexual training job.

31
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,250
I'm looking forward to having kids

32
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,830
That's right

33
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,290
Is it moving yet?

34
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,330
It's only been a month so I'm not moving yet

35
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,450
That's right

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,300
Let's get married

37
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,220
Every single day, every single day

38
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,180
You promised me you wouldn't do it until the baby was born.

39
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,070
I haven't done it even once since I found out I was pregnant.

40
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,930
I can't stand it.

41
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,360
No, hold on.

42
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,260
Got it

43
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,420
Speaking of which

44
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,980
There was a senior girl named Rena who I used to be close with.

45
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,610
Recently, I contacted him for the first time in a while.

46
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,710
There was a octopus living really close by.

47
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,050
So we ended up playing with each other's breasts.

48
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,210
Can I call you home?

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,420
Yes

50
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,460
please

51
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:29,760
Thank you. It's been a while.

52
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,440
How many years has it been?

53
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,760
It's been 10 years

54
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Has it been that long?

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,640
It hasn't changed at all.

56
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,900
The layers haven’t changed at all either.

57
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,020
Recently I did this

58
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,800
About 3 months ago

59
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,260
Amazing, I've always been here

60
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,040
Ah, how many years has it been?

61
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,440
Well, maybe five or six years.

62
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,740
Atka mackerel I see

63
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,100
I bought a house.

64
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,000
That

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh no

66
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,020
Nice

67
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,120
still

68
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,560
Not yet

69
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,920
It's going to be hard from now on

70
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,780
I have kids after all.

71
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,240
Feeling like

72
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,020
That's right.

73
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,160
Congratulations, right?

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,020
Amazing!

75
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,680
Because I'm useless

76
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,580
but

77
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,820
I just wanted a child.

78
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,360
I moved because my previous house was too noisy.

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,100
The timing is...

80
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,340
Are you used to it around here?

81
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,400
Aren't supermarkets a little expensive?

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,900
Eh! Expensive?!

83
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,700
Was that place too cheap?

84
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,220
Ah, really.

85
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,400
Right there

86
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,960
Ah, yes, a bit expensive.

87
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,200
Big shop on the other side

88
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,100
So maybe I'll go there then.

89
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,080
Maybe that would be cheaper.

90
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,680
Are there any good restaurants around here?

91
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,240
It's delicious... Oh! There are quite a lot of them.

92
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,920
What do you think?

93
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,860
Let's go for lunch next time

94
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,200
Ah, that's basically it.

95
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,420
It's easier to get out during the day

96
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,640
Recently there's a pizza place in front of the station.

97
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,880
Ah, Mr. Pisayan, I've never been there.

98
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,200
It's always lined up

99
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,840
Yes. It's hard to get in because there's a line.

100
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,580
Yeah, let's go.

101
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,080
Let's go

102
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,280
So you're still not with your husband around here?

103
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,980
That's right.

104
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,940
I moved and had a lot of trouble.

105
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,300
That's right, I'm still not calm

106
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,900
I'll enjoy having this

107
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,640
It was a little hot

108
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,780
Hey, if you say so

109
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,040
What kind of person is Tanzo?

110
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,600
What is it?

111
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,360
That's so kind.

112
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,100
That's kind, I like it

113
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,360
I feel like I've become even kinder since having a child.

114
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,240
Are you naturally kind?

115
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Yeah. It's kind, but it feels kind of nice.

116
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,580
I'm jealous!

117
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,500
My house is completely different now.

118
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,160
Is that true?

119
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,140
Karan has been with me for about five years.

120
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,600
Long thread

121
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,730
Is your house natural?

122
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,630
But if he's nice, then it's okay, right?

123
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,170
Do you not usually fight?

124
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,910
I feel like I've surpassed that already.

125
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,610
Is it getting cold?

126
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,290
Thank you

127
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,830
Sorry to bother you

128
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,750
I'd like to introduce you to Rena, who I spoke to yesterday.

129
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,590
Oh, thank you for your help.

130
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,410
Nice to meet you

131
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,930
Please take your time.

132
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:52,850
thank you

133
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:58,930
Are you okay? Husband

134
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,850
I feel like it's totally fine.

135
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,410
It's true, it seems sturdy and gentle.

136
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,150
Is that true?

137
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,250
That's nice, I'm jealous

138
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,190
Next time I meet Rena's Danzo

139
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,830
Yes, absolutely. Please come and visit us.

140
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,430
I want to go

141
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,090
It's definitely stylish.

142
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,750
That's not true. I totally agree.

143
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,330
Is that true?

144
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,370
The interior design used to be quite elaborate, didn't it?

145
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,390
Ah! Mingkai is

146
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,630
But after I got married,

147
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,530
Oh yeah

148
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,550
Life after all...

149
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,070
It will change a little bit.

150
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,390
Certainly.

151
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,490
I want to look a little more stylish, but I'm not sure.

152
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,190
It's difficult, isn't it?

153
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,750
Oh, really. I want to dress up a bit more.

154
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,730
But it's just beginning

155
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,490
I haven't even put away the cardboard boxes yet.

156
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,170
No, it's not that hard if you're pregnant.

157
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,150
Not quite there yet

158
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,790
But somehow it hasn't grown much.

159
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:04,650
Keiko

160
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:05,730
what

161
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,930
Next week, Saturday and Sunday are consecutive holidays.

162
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:09,650
Should I go somewhere?

163
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,570
Yes, I want to go.

164
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,950
Well, I'll look for it.

165
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:16,570
thank you

166
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Let's practice

167
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,820
I'm telling you, no.

168
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,440
Please, just once

169
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,860
No

170
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,570
Soap?

171
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,140
sorry

172
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:13,990
Just once

173
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,740
Sorry for the wait

174
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,700
Have fun today too

175
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,260
The room is here

176
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,000
thank you

177
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,500
Well then, excuse me.

178
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,300
nice to meet you

179
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,700
It's Rena right?

180
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,360
Wrong.

181
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,460
It's definitely Rena

182
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,180
How do you end up working in a place like this?

183
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,610
Umm...

184
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,940
Please keep this a secret

185
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,560
Of course. I want to wear something like this and see the back.

186
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,670
Seriously... please keep it a secret

187
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,840
It's okay! I keep my promises.

188
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,620
But why?

189
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,630
Please don't listen to that

190
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,370
Let's stop talking darkly

191
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,070
I came all the way here with my customers.

192
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:55,150
Oh, you have to enjoy it a lot. I'll be happy to serve you.

193
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,660
Let's get started

194
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,360
I'm kind of nervous.

195
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,400
Do you come to places like this often?

196
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,760
This is the first time since we got married.

197
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,020
That's right

198
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,160
Did you come a lot before you got married?

199
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,260
Well, that too... occasionally.

200
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,880
How is the practice going?

201
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,780
Not from the new birth

202
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,410
Well then, I'm trying my best

203
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,210
oh dear

204
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,180
Did you never touch her boobs?

205
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,240
Well, yes

206
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,640
Is it because he's a baby?

207
00:14:34,890 --> 00:15:01,200
♪ Music

208
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,780
It hurts so much

209
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,820
I'm so shocked.

210
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,770
Don't you want to do something more pleasurable?

211
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,650
Ah, I like it.

212
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,910
So, should we go to Matt?

213
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,160
Hey, let's play again

214
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,230
Let's go

215
00:15:49,230 --> 00:16:13,230
Ah! Yes!

216
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:17,160
Is it okay? It's hot.

217
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,300
it's okay

218
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,910
Is this Matt's first time?

219
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,890
Yes, Matato is the first

220
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,810
I'm looking forward to it.

221
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,620
It's not cold

222
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,520
Are you okay

223
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,380
It's so slippery though

224
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,280
It feels strange.

225
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:14,780
Slipping again

226
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,300
You don't do this if you oversleep.

227
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,580
I can't

228
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:30,440
Is this okay?

229
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:54,980
What it feels like

230
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,890
The feeling was good

231
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,750
Sleepy, true

232
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,040
Was it just normal sex with Keiko?

233
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,020
- Practice.

234
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,560
No, that's... normal.

235
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,800
There's something wrong.

236
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,750
Eh, what is it like?

237
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,390
I wonder what kind of sex they have

238
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,550
I'm curious.

239
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:21,900
Are you okay

240
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,120
Ahh! Feels good

241
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,880
Yes, okay.

242
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:47,190
I'll win a lot of New Year's money

243
00:19:48,690 --> 00:20:09,850
Did you get a rice ball?

244
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:24,180
It has already arrived in the meantime

245
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,860
That's true...

246
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,700
It's beautiful, isn't it?

247
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,720
thank you

248
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,720
I thought it was a thin time

249
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,480
No, I just happened to see a lot of different things.

250
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,420
There are quite a few

251
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,980
I can't say for sure.

252
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,160
Y-yes.

253
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:16,680
Do you like bread?

254
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,180
Yes, I like it.

255
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,640
nice

256
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,250
Are you rubbing your neck?

257
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,850
The head is easy to understand

258
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:01,350
Let's definitely try it

259
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,960
I remember your funny face

260
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,840
This is my first time

261
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,620
Who has never drunk it?

262
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,740
Is it ticklish?

263
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,500
No, it's really good.

264
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,900
She's dressed in a naughty way.

265
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,160
It's turned into a terrible powder.

266
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,380
A very horny old man

267
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:11,370
Are you touching everything?

268
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,740
hot

269
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,780
Where does it feel good?

270
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,660
1cm left in all

271
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,280
here

272
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,260
It's so annoying.

273
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,520
Hold on a cup

274
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,070
Are you okay

275
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,430
My body wants to do that.

276
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,870
Where is this being assigned?

277
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,190
In the back

278
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,430
Amazing! You've really taken the time

279
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,710
You're starting to get excited now.

280
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,380
Your feet are big

281
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,800
Ah, it's delicious.

282
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,320
Are you tired?

283
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,650
I was surprised

284
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,890
Can you lie on your back next time?

285
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,590
If we continue like this, we won't be able to see anything anymore

286
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,110
Lend me a hand

287
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,250
I'll help you.

288
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,040
Wow, it's become like this now

289
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,520
Because it's slippery

290
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,240
I'm getting stuck

291
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,640
Wow, it's been ringing like this for a day.

292
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,410
Did you see this?

293
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:30,570
I can see your ass

294
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,510
Wow, that's amazing.

295
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:43,380
Okay, put it in.

296
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,400
delicious

297
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,120
Grandpa, you are ethics

298
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,430
sorry

299
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:56,060
It makes it easier for my waist to be pinched.

300
00:34:56,370 --> 00:35:07,300
Feeling hungry?

301
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,640
Doesn't it hurt??

302
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,200
The motion is slippery

303
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,210
Does it feel good?

304
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,590
Ah, yes.

305
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,960
After all, if you come to Softland, you want to get in, right?

306
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:31,860
No... already

307
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:39,000
Can I put it in this?

308
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,330
I'm glad it's the way it is

309
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,730
Keep it on

310
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,500
This is what happens

311
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,870
So the entrance is just like this.

312
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,870
Let's do it

313
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,030
It's so big!

314
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,250
here?

315
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,620
Oh, I walked in next to it.

316
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,660
this is···

317
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:39,430
It's in the back. Kinky is big.

318
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:16,520
This one too...

319
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:33,680
How clicked is it?

320
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,970
It's amazing!

321
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:44,350
Because it's so cool.

322
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:47,080
Hey, you can put it in here

323
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,040
Just like this forever

324
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,140
It's really hard, Teatin said.

325
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,800
Only the hands are in

326
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,960
- I can type everything

327
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,060
There's a burr

328
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:38,010
One more left

329
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,460
I want you to follow me from behind

330
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,780
Is it me?

331
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,210
I will do my best

332
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,990
It's dangerous so be careful

333
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,780
Wow, amazing!

334
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:59,710
Hey, feels good

335
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:03,250
Sorry, can you help me?

336
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,430
wait a minute

337
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,290
First sex feeling

338
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,070
This is the last one

339
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,410
Become a lot stronger

340
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:53,970
amazing

341
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:55,470
There

342
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:58,630
I'm not tired

343
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:32,520
amazing

344
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:37,220
Ah, it's hot.

345
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,060
Sweet and different?

346
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,360
Should I put it in every time?

347
00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:16,790
☀Did it feel good? Yes

348
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:27,150
Please come again anytime.

349
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,300
I've been waiting for you

350
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:57,140
By the way, haven't they been talking about specifications lately?

351
00:51:58,590 --> 00:51:59,970
Oh no, well, look.

352
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:01,590
Myself, come on.

353
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:04,830
I thought it was selfish of me so I decided to just put up with it.

354
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,180
thank you

355
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:16,490
By the way, Rena is coming again this weekend. Is that okay?

356
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,390
Huh... ah... huh...?

357
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,690
Ah yeah. It's okay.

358
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,250
Sorry for coming back again

359
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,670
Please wear it anytime.

360
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:31,370
thank you

361
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:34,390
I might actually go because I'm really bored.

362
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:35,850
I'm bored too.

363
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,390
Please feel free to come anytime.

364
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:38,110
it was good

365
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:39,550
The tea looks delicious

366
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,540
Isn't this tea really delicious?

367
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:49,340
Is that true? There's a store in front of the station that always has a line.

368
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,180
I bought it there

369
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,100
Even though there was a huge line

370
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,160
Yes, I always had to line up, so I couldn't buy it.

371
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,100
I'm still worried and trying my best

372
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,100
But it's very delicious

373
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:00,760
Really?

374
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,980
I can't stand it anymore

375
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,600
good morning.

376
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:20,960
Really delicious!

377
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:22,920
Would you like another serving?

378
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,140
Can I have it?

379
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,780
Thank you, sorry

380
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,370
It's totally fine

381
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:43,170
Let's go shopping

382
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:43,750
Okay.

383
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:44,030
please

384
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:44,830
Please, you don't have to go.

385
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:46,210
No, no, it's right there.

386
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:47,510
Because Asaka is lining up

387
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:49,270
it's okay

388
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:50,690
No, it's not okay? Because I'm pregnant.

389
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:51,930
Me too

390
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:52,730
I want to drink it again

391
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:54,110
It's really okay

392
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:55,410
Well then, I'm off.

393
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:57,470
Please wait

394
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:58,130
Don't push yourself

395
00:53:58,130 --> 00:53:58,990
that's right

396
00:53:58,990 --> 00:53:59,510
Because it's right there

397
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:00,470
sorry

398
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:31,390
You're silent.

399
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,570
Of course.

400
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,260
Thank you for keeping your promise

401
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,780
Wh-what are you doing?

402
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:58,000
I kept my promise

403
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,020
But...

404
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,500
No, already, that

405
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,580
After all, I was married.

406
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:13,880
Are you okay

407
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,240
There's a huge line of tea shops over there.

408
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,030
That's right.

409
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,610
There's nothing else like it.

410
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:29,290
Ah, yes.

411
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:32,810
Won't you let me do it from now on?

412
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:35,650
Well… yes

413
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,800
So take it off.

414
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,240
Are you sure?

415
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,640
It's okay, Keiko. She hasn't come home yet.

416
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,250
You've been found out, right?

417
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:15,930
Because it has become like this

418
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:21,320
By the time you arrived,

419
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:26,470
If it gets found out, things will be bad.

420
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:27,970
It's okay, you won't get caught

421
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,740
I just went there.

422
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,960
You'll definitely have to queue for 30 minutes there

423
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,900
30 minutes

424
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,310
It's become like this

425
00:56:48,220 --> 00:57:02,690
But outside of the store,

426
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:06,890
It's okay. I was the one who fooled you today.

427
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:08,810
sorry

428
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:19,450
It won't go down

429
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,640
Look! I've been waiting this long.

430
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:37,360
Poor thing, they don't let you do what you want.

431
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,300
Is your hair getting stiff?

432
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:06,470
what happened

433
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:12,610
I have a feeling that something bad will happen.

434
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,460
It was a big problem.

435
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:37,970
I didn't really touch it much at the store, did I?

436
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:52,840
on second thoughts…

437
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:04,640
Nasty hand gestures

438
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,340
I'll do this like crazy.

439
00:59:55,940 --> 01:00:15,370
Do you want to have this dick pinched?

440
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:21,250
It's not slimy, but it's fine today.

441
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:31,900
I'll put it in here for you, teen

442
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:33,860
please

443
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,460
It's become a bed

444
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:49,170
Before you go to bed in the morning, try tasting Grandpa.

445
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:08,670
Amazing hip movement

446
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:12,170
Doesn't it feel weird at home?

447
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:14,190
What it feels like

448
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,410
Usually, I die in a place like this.

449
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:18,750
You're crying, right?

450
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,410
What, where are you crying?

451
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,810
It's a bedroom

452
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:35,140
You can put your hand in

453
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:36,380
please

454
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,380
Feels good

455
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,800
Are you nervous?

456
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:26,340
Yeah, I'm nervous.

457
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,780
Because it's my house

458
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:28,600
no

459
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,860
In your own home

460
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,340
He acts all high and mighty.

461
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,520
It's amazing, see?

462
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:47,180
It's getting bigger and bigger

463
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:47,780
It has become

464
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,440
Can you drink it?

465
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:41,550
Where does it feel good?

466
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:43,590
Stacked on my chest

467
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:49,490
Today, as a thank you, I'll give you something nice

468
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,040
kitchen?

469
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,720
here

470
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,240
Damn

471
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:58,780
Sigh

472
01:05:58,780 --> 01:05:59,620
Damn

473
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:08,910
Sky shore

474
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:10,370
I cut off Bandara.

475
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:24,690
After

476
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,360
half

477
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:47,920
hot

478
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:53,320
terrible

479
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:01,210
Hit me

480
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:23,540
Ah, you're following me, right? I'm behind you.

481
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:53,990
Awesome!

482
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,620
It's so hard and hard!

483
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:33,160
If that happens, I'll go right away

484
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:38,440
That's fine. Let out what you've been saving up.

485
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,730
Wow, amazing!

486
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,180
Very scary

487
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:10,390
Eh?

488
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:11,910
Ah, it feels good

489
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:13,990
It feels so good

490
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:22,360
Wow, amazing!

491
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:34,990
Really, no.

492
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:58,680
There are so many!

493
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,540
It's dripping

494
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:07,130
That's a great nose

495
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:11,260
Did it feel good?

496
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:17,240
If you come to our store, we'll give you even more service.

497
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:33,730
I'm glad you came again

498
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:37,520
I want to meet Rena too.

499
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:40,720
I won't change the things I don't like

500
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,320
If I don't let it happen anymore

501
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:48,970
I'm going to do a lot of isavish today

502
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:50,990
It started to feel good.

503
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,160
Wash your body.

504
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:56,880
please

505
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,300
Give me your legs!

506
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:26,750
It's fresh.

507
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:29,850
Really? You wouldn't do something like this

508
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:31,930
I have never done it.

509
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:33,650
I'm also practicing.

510
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:37,410
Sometimes we take a bath together

511
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:39,730
Totally cute

512
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,080
Do you sometimes take a bath?

513
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:50,940
I agree

514
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,940
How does it feel?

515
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:27,130
If they're together, I guess they'll wash them.

516
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:30,450
I don't wash it

517
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:33,850
Is that so?

518
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:36,670
I'm moving and it's going to be smaller

519
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:38,290
Because the room is spacious

520
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:43,270
Oh, really? The bathtub was big before too.

521
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,260
Have you ever been treated like this before?

522
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,360
What does it feel like?

523
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:00,820
Very hot

524
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:02,960
Warm

525
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:05,400
No, it's hot.

526
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,440
What is hitting?

527
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:21,040
I'll wash this one too.

528
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:40,080
Lend it to the other hand

529
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:48,760
Well then, this time from here

530
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,160
Is it hot here too?

531
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,200
Ah, it's too hot

532
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:06,420
Even after it dries, it's starting to feel dull

533
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:29,940
That's amazing.

534
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,560
What do you think?

535
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,340
While it's still warm,

536
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:38,920
Feeling

537
01:15:56,670 --> 01:15:58,070
I wonder if it's beautiful now

538
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:02,730
But you have to wash your back too.

539
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:26,160
Feels good?

540
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,150
I'll make everything beautiful

541
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:53,850
Ah, yes.

542
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,920
Finally, we have to wash the important parts.

543
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:53,780
Look at that! And it's become like this.

544
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:54,780
Ah, yes.

545
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:30,910
Is there anything else I'm missing?

546
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:33,090
it's okay

547
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:36,890
Removes cleanly

548
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:55,780
I'll warm it up next time

549
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:09,550
This feels really good

550
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:20,180
Do you like it?

551
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:41,040
How's your ass?

552
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:45,740
It's really good

553
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,620
Wow, it's getting lukewarm.

554
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:16,390
Do you get creepy?

555
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:19,090
No, it gives me goosebumps.

556
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:29,100
Can I add more water?

557
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:04,210
Let me hold it in my hand

558
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:31,690
Now I need a good wash

559
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:58,280
I'm washing

560
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:25,010
If you keep doing it like this, will you do it while wet?

561
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,300
Huu-chin-chan, get wet.

562
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,670
Wow, that feels good

563
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:05,590
This also feels good

564
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:07,730
That's a stupid mistake

565
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,760
It smells good

566
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:08,890
Can be produced in large quantities

567
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:18,010
sorry

568
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:20,190
I love you

569
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:27,210
It felt so good.

570
01:26:29,110 --> 01:26:30,490
Can you still get it out today?

571
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:32,710
Of course!

572
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:36,150
But it's extremely brilliant

573
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:39,150
That's because Rena is attractive.

574
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:43,010
Well then, shall I go to the bathroom and rinse?

575
01:27:48,430 --> 01:28:02,440
Wait a minute, get well soon

576
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:50,550
I am very satisfied.

577
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:56,700
It has a spicy and sweet taste

578
01:28:56,700 --> 01:29:20,620
What are your feelings?

579
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:28,740
To express the greatness of it,

580
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,860
Can I play with your boobs?

581
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:40,360
Ah, yes.

582
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:46,250
Shall I touch it?

583
01:29:53,800 --> 01:30:03,300
Ah, so much.

584
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,320
It felt good

585
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,780
It's so solid

586
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:24,740
Ahh, it feels good

587
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,540
Does it feel good?

588
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:02,240
Boobs?

589
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:42,860
Oh, that's so unfair.

590
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:09,410
Hmm, huh?

591
01:32:28,370 --> 01:32:31,770
I want to feel better

592
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:34,870
I want to put

593
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:36,750
May I

594
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:39,860
Well, I'll put it in.

595
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:48,780
Swoosh

596
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:13,680
Hey, Reinan

597
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:18,450
Haven't you done it recently?

598
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:24,170
Do you sometimes

599
01:35:25,650 --> 01:35:26,910
sorry

600
01:35:27,690 --> 01:35:30,270
I've been busy and tired lately

601
01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:34,670
Ah… that’s right.

602
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:43,080
I felt fulfilled thanks to Ken.

603
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:51,900
And at some point, I started looking forward to Ken's visit.

604
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,480
I'm home

605
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,940
This is you, Reina.

606
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,000
Huh? No, what's that?

607
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:09,960
I fell here

608
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:13,320
Not me though

609
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:16,540
If it's not you then who?

610
01:37:20,730 --> 01:37:23,370
You've been coming home late lately.

611
01:37:25,290 --> 01:37:26,010
Well, a little

612
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:30,180
Do you think you'll spend such a night at a normal job?

613
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:33,020
Well, there were a lot of things

614
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,480
What do you mean by various things?

615
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:36,960
Well, there are a lot of them.

616
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,860
What are you hiding?

617
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:42,860
I'm not hiding anything.

618
01:37:47,450 --> 01:37:48,530
What does this mean?

619
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:55,100
It's strange that this fell

620
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:58,220
Not mine

621
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:03,120
Don't get angry

622
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
To be honest

623
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:10,820
I'm sorry

624
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:17,830
Actually, I had no choice because of my home loan.

625
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:24,180
But why is it like that?

626
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:27,340
Thank you very much everyone

627
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:30,160
I was doing a lot of things.

628
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:32,080
Home loans

629
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:36,610
Because I wanted to make my life with you more fun

630
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:42,300
This was the place where there was no salary.

631
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:45,940
I'm really sorry.

632
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:49,780
Sorry, you

633
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:53,240
Really trash

634
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:54,600
Forgive me

635
01:38:56,690 --> 01:38:58,790
I'm really sorry.

636
01:38:59,390 --> 01:39:00,410
Really, inside

637
01:39:00,410 --> 01:39:02,230
radar

638
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:06,250
It's bad that I don't earn much

639
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:09,760
That's not true.

640
01:39:11,290 --> 01:39:12,130
I'm a substitute

641
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:15,780
Yeah. I'm quitting my job.

642
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:17,540
Lena

643
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:26,700
But I can't do it suddenly, so please let me come to work this week.

644
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:33,200
I get it, but it really should be the last one

645
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:41,160
I'd like to ask for more service today

646
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:46,470
Well, you see

647
01:39:48,870 --> 01:39:50,510
what's wrong?

648
01:39:52,970 --> 01:39:53,730
Actually, it's good

649
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:56,830
My husband found out about this job.

650
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:04,410
So today is my last day at work.

651
01:40:06,990 --> 01:40:08,030
That's right

652
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:13,340
Don't make such a sad face

653
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:15,840
Today is the last day

654
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:19,520
So I'll give you lots of service.

655
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:23,800
Hey, now put on a smile

656
01:40:26,330 --> 01:40:27,470
Is it okay if it's the last one?

657
01:40:31,010 --> 01:40:32,090
Laugh

658
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:40,300
Sorry

659
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:34,740
It's delicious

660
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:54,290
Feels good?

661
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:03,280
It really makes me feel better

662
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:42,660
amazing

663
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,940
Huh?

664
01:45:03,790 --> 01:45:04,750
What do you want?

665
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,560
I want you to feel good with Russian

666
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:14,580
Try that

667
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:19,180
So do what you love

668
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:56,900
Well then, let's have a slippery drink.

669
01:45:59,080 --> 01:47:07,360
I'm going to sleep, so my stomach is warm.

670
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:07,620
Are you okay?

671
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:23,350
This one too

672
01:47:23,350 --> 01:47:24,930
Let's go to the feet

673
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:06,520
Does it not feel good at all where your boobs are touching you?

674
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:52,540
Can't you do this at home?

675
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:54,720
Just do your best.

676
01:50:02,610 --> 01:50:05,750
You're dressed so sexy.

677
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,160
Chi-chin is awake

678
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:29,200
It's getting bigger

679
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,780
I'll be fine soon

680
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:36,760
Sit Down

681
01:51:17,650 --> 01:51:19,690
How about something like this?

682
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,720
Ah, it's so slippery

683
01:51:43,610 --> 01:51:46,190
Ah, what a naughty look

684
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:11,470
This is a very good Eve.

685
01:53:14,090 --> 01:53:16,510
I'm soaked now

686
01:53:50,860 --> 01:54:00,990
Does it hurt?

687
01:54:01,890 --> 01:54:03,290
I want to touch it

688
01:54:04,490 --> 01:54:07,510
Okay, touch it.

689
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:09,270
Slimy body

690
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:13,200
be careful

691
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:18,640
Are you okay?

692
01:54:22,770 --> 01:54:24,570
It's so slippery

693
01:54:30,430 --> 01:54:43,020
It's different from the usual irresistible

694
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,480
This is the last one, so I'll do my best

695
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:01,780
amazing

696
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:05,380
I slept too long

697
01:56:30,600 --> 01:57:09,460
Ah, it feels good

698
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:23,990
feel?

699
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:56,440
I can get it

700
01:57:58,280 --> 01:58:08,910
Oh, that's good

701
02:01:59,080 --> 02:01:59,460
delicious

702
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:01,300
Wow, what a slimy smell

703
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:48,060
I drink

704
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:37,910
Ahh, feels good!

705
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:52,500
Ah, it feels good

706
02:03:56,310 --> 02:04:09,220
Wow

707
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:20,060
Hmm...

708
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:38,660
Hey, I want to put it in

709
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,280
Well, I put it in

710
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:43,860
Hmm.

711
02:04:46,940 --> 02:04:49,100
I'll put my hands on the sure thing

712
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,700
Ah, is it okay to make Tensel soft?

713
02:05:03,130 --> 02:05:04,850
This is still big

714
02:05:35,990 --> 02:05:37,290
Diaclean is vomiting

715
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:41,200
It's so crunchy!

716
02:05:43,260 --> 02:06:02,200
The breath is hitting

717
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:16,460
It's a little hard

718
02:08:42,050 --> 02:08:43,410
Very hard

719
02:08:45,540 --> 02:10:41,360
Ahh, that feels good!

720
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:46,640
Hit the bed

721
02:11:04,050 --> 02:11:06,600
over there

722
02:11:27,530 --> 02:11:28,070
Hmm...

723
02:14:26,540 --> 02:14:27,780
Squeak

724
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:47,180
Aaaah

725
02:14:47,180 --> 02:14:47,940
high

726
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:22,760
open

727
02:16:55,100 --> 02:16:55,140
Han

728
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:14,080
Oh

729
02:17:14,080 --> 02:18:08,880
go

730
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:09,740
GO

731
02:18:09,740 --> 02:18:10,180
I'm coming

732
02:18:19,310 --> 02:18:20,130
Hmm.

733
02:18:31,870 --> 02:18:32,730
good

734
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:34,910
me too

735
02:18:34,910 --> 02:18:36,210
It felt good

736
02:18:36,210 --> 02:18:37,270
Fufu

737
02:18:37,270 --> 02:18:37,970
Wow

738
02:18:46,440 --> 02:18:50,620
Ah, I'm tired.

739
02:18:50,900 --> 02:18:54,000
It was close but fun

740
02:18:55,300 --> 02:18:56,420
Me too.

741
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:18,880
hey

742
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:23,380
Huh?

743
02:19:51,320 --> 02:20:02,420
everyone

744
02:20:02,420 --> 02:20:04,970
Has it already entered a stable period?

745
02:20:06,010 --> 02:20:06,970
I agree

746
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:12,820
Well, let's do it.

747
02:20:13,980 --> 02:20:16,380
I told you not to until the baby is born.

748
02:20:18,650 --> 02:20:19,610
Understood

749
02:20:40,130 --> 02:20:42,750
Should I go to a soapland for the first time in a while?

750
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:48,680
I'm so sorry

751
02:20:48,680 --> 02:20:58,380
So, please have fun today too.

752
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:00,740
The room is here

753
02:21:04,250 --> 02:21:05,510
Excuse me

754
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:18,540
It's Ena, have fun today

755
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:21,500
Why?

756
02:21:24,390 --> 02:21:26,110
You came here to have fun today

757
02:22:00,460 --> 02:22:03,300
